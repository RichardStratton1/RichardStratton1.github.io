<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches.

The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
