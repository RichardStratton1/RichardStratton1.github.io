Renting provides economical and practical solutions to reflect the changing needs of your business and helps you better adjust to any aberrations in your daily routine. Note: In order to receive your C4 Forklift Operation Certification, you must take and pass a performance evaluation given by your employer at your job site. All-terrain and off-road tires in very large sizes can be crucial for conquering particularly difficult and hazardous trails.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>

Many truck shoppers in the Lexington, Frankfort, Winchester, and Nicholasville area know they can count on Georgetown Auto Sales to give them a great selection of trucks, lifted or not, and a fair deal with honest sales.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>
<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

Unauthorized personnel shall not be permitted to ride on powered industrial trucks. RICO's Pegasus counterbalance forklift series redefines material handling with our four wheel sit-down truck.</p>

We also provide safety training classes that meet OSHA guidelines for forklift operation. With this new generation of straight-mast forklifts, there are plenty of options to choose from.
