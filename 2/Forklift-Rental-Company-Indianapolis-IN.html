<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards. This is not always a terrible thing, but it often takes some getting used to, especially if you have driven the standard model and then change to a lifted truck.

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
