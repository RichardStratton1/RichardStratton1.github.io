<p>The forklift driver training will cover all the key areas; such as Health and Safety Executive (HSE) legislation and safety guidelines, an introduction to the forklift truck, how to start, stop and basic maneuvering, operating with pallets and loads, and difficult loads.

Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
