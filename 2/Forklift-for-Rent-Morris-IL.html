This amount also plays a key factor in the vehicle's stability — a forklift that carries too much weight isn't stable.

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
