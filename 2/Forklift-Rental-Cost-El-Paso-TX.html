<p>While standard counterbalance forklifts need a good amount of space to make turns, a three-wheel forklift can actually spin in a very tight circle. Of course, Chevrolet already produces a number of fantastic off-road trucks with dedicated trims designed to take on a wide range of trails out there. They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.
