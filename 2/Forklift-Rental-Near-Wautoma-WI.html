The PTH Series hand pallet jack features solid construction and generous use of steel - especially at critical stress points - to deliver for long-lasting performance. Delivery and pickup are not usually included in a forklift rental agreement. We employ a team of skilled professionals, who fabricate these products in varied configurations by using best quality raw material and progressive technology.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
