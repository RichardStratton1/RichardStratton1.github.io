<h2>New & Used Forklifts, Forklift Service, Parts, Rentals & Training Hewitt </h2>
<p>Do not overload a lift truck. The most common type of forklift has a heavy counterweight over the rear tires to balance the load.

If you see anything you want to learn more about before visiting, our sales and service staff welcome your calls.</p>

<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
