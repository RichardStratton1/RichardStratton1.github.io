If you drive a forklift on an incline, you must keep the load on the uphill side. Flexibility is perhaps the greatest benefit to renting a forklift versus buying. We have new and used forklifts for sale and as rentals.</p>
<p>Forklifts, at maximum, can only travel 8 mph or 3 mph around people, but even at that speed, one of these 4-ton vehicle's steel tusks can puncture your machinery and shut down your operation. We will conduct a learner analysis to identify the duration of training required for those with limited or no experience, whereas experienced operators can attend a one day Experienced Worker Assessment (Test Only).</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>

The special handle design offers protection for the operator's handle and makes raising loads and steering easier. These forklifts travel at high and fast speeds. Battery Operated Pallet Trucks are used to lift and move pallets.</p>
