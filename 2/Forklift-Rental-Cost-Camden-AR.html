<p>Outfit your shop with confidence, knowing that Gray jacks and Gray lifts are some of the best jacking and lifting products on the market and backed not only by a manufacturer lifetime warranty but also quick and convenient repairs from Ohio Power Tool. A suspension lift is a more popular option and gives you more ground clearance than a body lift - it's the only way to get enough height for larger tires.</p>
<h2>Be Aware When Operating a Fork Lift Truck in Camden </h2>
<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>But palletisation really enhances the material handling efficiency and throughput. These powerful machines can handle very heavy loads and operate on all kinds of difficult terrain. View our entire inventory of New or Used Rough Terrain Forklift Equipment. However, it does suggest that people without previous experience driving a lifted truck should test-drive one of a similar height before lifting their own.</p>
<p>Front flotation tyres generate an outstanding stability of loads on forks to transport heavy weight. Improved tech and advanced builds make these forklifts very safe.
