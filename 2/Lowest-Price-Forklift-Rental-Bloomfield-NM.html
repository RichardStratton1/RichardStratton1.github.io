<p>Lift kits can put added pressure on the driveshaft angles , causing intense vibrations at peak speeds. If you require an order picking forklift that can utilised for high racking situations, we have a range that can complete these tasks with ease. Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>

The 35 Logistics counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Counterbalance and reach forklifts are two commonly used types of truck throughout a variety of industries. This can get a bit tricky and technical, so always make sure you have a licensed mechanic install this type of lift kit to ensure that the suspension still works afterward.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
