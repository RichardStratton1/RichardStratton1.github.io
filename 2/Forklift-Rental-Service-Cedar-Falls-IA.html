This is the most common type of forklift, used in warehouses and shipping centers all over the world. If you have never really thought much about lifted trucks before, then you might wonder why you would ever want a truck lifted up in the first place.</p>

<p>Simply put, a pallet jack is a large tool used to lift and move heavy pallets. Along with selling new and used forklifts, ProLift offers forklift rentals Using a rental is ideal when the need for a forklift is limited - as short as 1 day - or you have a sudden or unexpected need. We provide the best Warranty in the business and can offer outstanding Lease & Finance packages.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
