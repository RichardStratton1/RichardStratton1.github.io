<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks.

<p>Truck should be placed on an initially level test platform in a position that the center line of the truck is per-perpendicular the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.
