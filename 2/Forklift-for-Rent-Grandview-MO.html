Full Free Lift = A truck where the fork carriage travels to the top of the inner mast before the inner mast begins to rise. Service intervals of 1,000 operating hours mean that trucks operate reliably. Pinch point hazards are also common when operating this type of forklift truck.</p>

Large tires, smoke stacks, custom paint jobs, longer towing style mirrors, shiny headlights, and accent lighting are common. Sunbelt Rentals supports the Restoring Independence Supporting Empowerment” or R.I.S.E. program, providing specially adapted custom smart homes for America's most severely wounded veterans and their families.</p>
