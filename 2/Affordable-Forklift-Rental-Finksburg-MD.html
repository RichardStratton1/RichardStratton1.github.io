<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries.

<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle.

If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
