A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have.

You would have to determine whether or not you are operating on a ramp, how heavy the load is, the kind of condition the pallet truck is in, and the distance you have to cover.

The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>

Don't pay for a 5,000 lb. capacity truck to move 2,000 lbs.
