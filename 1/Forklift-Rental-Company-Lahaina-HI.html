Please note: Forklifts are rated according to how much weight they can lift, starting at 3,000 lbs and going up to 35,000 lbs and much more.</p>
<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend.

They feature specially-designed lifting carriages and come in two configurations: with mast and with reach.</p>

In fact, most body lift kits are designed to work with suspension lift kits. Here, Linde uses protective operator platforms in the pallet trucks and equips pedestrian models with protective combined braking and assistance systems: The reverse current brakes are automatically active when the operator releases the drive pedal or switch.</p>
