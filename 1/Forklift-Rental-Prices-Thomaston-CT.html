Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>

Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses.
