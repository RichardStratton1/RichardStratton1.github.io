<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers. Make sure that the lifted truck has modified brakes with larger than normal rotors and calipers that are capable of stopping the truck in a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>This Course has been designed for potential and existing plant operators who have received no formal instruction and those requiring refresher training. Rental forklifts are maintained to Crown's high standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Buying vertical order pickers comes in handy when the main job is order picking at increased requirements for productivity.</p>

<p>Come see us today at our brand new larger premises with more forklifts on site than ever before. These tests are intended to be applied to prototype trucks on a selective basis as required by the user or manufacturer. Our innovations include the unique BT Pro Lifter, which easily moves a heavy load, reducing manual effort by up to 67%. Many people choose to hire their forklifts, but there are a multitude of benefits associated with buying forklifts outright.</p>
<p>Considered the most common type of forklift truck overall, counterbalanced models are designed with a weight that's built into the rear of the truck's body. Ausa T204H: This fork truck rental falls under the telehandler category, as it combines the lifting capacity of a forklift with the reach of a crane. If you see anything you want to learn more about before visiting, our sales and service staff welcome your calls.</p>

Heubel Shaw's large rental fleet includes Reach trucks, Stand up forklifts, sitdown 4-wheel and 3-wheel forklifts, order pickers and pallet jacks. Rather than installing between the body and frame, these kits are used to physically increase the height of the suspension for the pickup, which raises the body and frame.</p>

A body lift kit is much simpler to install - it just uses spacers underneath the cab to boost the height of the body.
