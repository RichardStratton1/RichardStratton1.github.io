Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

<p>The outstanding performance of the hydrostatic transmission with the permanent 4WD Compen® or connectable 4WD FullGrip® allows the easy carry of loads on the toughest grounds and narrow places. Every forklift is tailored to the required needs of your operation, providing the right solution for your warehouse operation.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
