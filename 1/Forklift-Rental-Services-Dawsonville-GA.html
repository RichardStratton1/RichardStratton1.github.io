<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope.

Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months.
