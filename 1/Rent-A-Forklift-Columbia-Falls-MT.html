Where possible, fork loops or jugs should be provided for handling by fork trucks. Whilst implementing some or all of the relevant measures above will greatly reduce the fall risk to operators, the best solution is to provide order pickers with fully enclosed platforms.</p>
<p>Low level pickers are inexpensive pickers that allow you to effectively perform material handling on low level warehouse shelves. Rent a Heli warehouse forklift with a 5000 lb load capacity. Like multi-directional forklifts, sideloaders make handling long loads much easier.
