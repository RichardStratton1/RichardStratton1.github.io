<p>This course is designed to provide experienced operators with relevant knowledge and understanding of practical use of the Industrial Counterbalance Forklift. Gas forklifts constantly need to be refilled, so the recurring need to purchase fuel makes the long-term costs hefty. If you are a forklift operator, be sure to fasten your seat belt before moving the equipment.

For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical or at full rearward till, whichever is less stable.</p>
<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing. If you test drive your lifted trucks hurriedly, you will fail to pay close attention to some signs you should be watching out for. The Forklift Order Picker Cages have durable wire mesh backs and side panels and are to be used in conjunction with a body harness (for working at heights).</p>
