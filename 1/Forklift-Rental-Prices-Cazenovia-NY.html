<h2>Electric Lift Truck Cazenovia</h2>
<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
