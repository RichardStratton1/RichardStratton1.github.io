The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
<p>Motorized hand trucks must enter elevator or other confined areas with load end forward. There is a structure of movable parts which enable proper operating of the forklifts.
