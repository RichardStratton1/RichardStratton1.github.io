<p>31. 31 Training Program Content (continued)  The requirements of the OSHA standard on powered industrial trucks must also be included in the initial operator training program. Forklifts can unload pallets of bricks, construction materials and steel joists from the delivery truck and transport them to the job site. The frame, cab, boom, and body of a tele-scoping-boom rough terrain forklift are usually fabricated by the forklift manufacturer.</p>
<p>Our manoeuvrable and versatile EFG counterbalance forklift trucks are designed for maximum performance at minimum energy consumption: latest generation 3-phase AC motors, highest efficiency thanks to PureEnergy concept, productivity-enhancing ergonomics and optimum safety. In the material handling industry, the uses of the electric forklift and electric reach stacker are both steadily increasing.</p>

Keep in mind that forklift rentals aren't the only warehouse equipment leases we'll do - floor cleaning equipment, personnel carriers, burden carriers and more are all available to rent out. Rough-terrrain lifts are particularly prone to abuse if they were employed at a construction site.</p>

It may be necessary to travel long distances with the load to the rear in reverse for most forklifts. Frequency of use and pallet transport distance should be taken into consideration when choosing between manual and electric pallet trucks.</p>
