<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled. Access Hire Australia have a range of rough terrain forklifts for hire to suit your needs including various operating weights, lift capacities and dimensions. One of the most important and widely used pieces of equipment in material handling, the lift truck is a powered industrial vehicle used to lift and transport materials for short distances.</p>
<p>As the name implies, reach trucks reach” into racking with an extendable carriage and forks to grab pallets that range from 2,500 to 5,500 lbs. This version is known as a deep-reach lift truck. The choice to lift your truck or not is ultimately going to come down to what you use the vehicle for and what you hope to get out of lifting it. If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<h2>Counterbalanced Forklift Trucks in Muldrow </h2>
<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both.

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
