<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Sometimes using a forklift for your pallet moving operation is like taking a bazooka to a knife fight. Increasing demand for forklifts across various industry verticals, such as food & beverage, e-commerce, general merchandise, and retail, will propel market size.
