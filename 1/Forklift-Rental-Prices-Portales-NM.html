<h2>Reach Fork Truck Portales</h2>
<p>Body lift kits work to lift the body of the vehicle but continues to keep the chassis and suspension at the same height in relation to the ground. This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
