A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification.
