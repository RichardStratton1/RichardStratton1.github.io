<p>Importantly, the electric pallet jack has been built with safety reverse button as well as the good quality steel. The four-wheel versions are Class 4 forklifts. The AUSA 3000-3500 kg forklifts are compact, have a high-performance hydrostatic transmission and are available in 2-wheel drive and 4x4 versions.

Place empty truck on initially level test platform in a position that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the test platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are order picker trucks that have forks that are fixed in front of the platform and thus cannot be moved. As a result, drivers will feel sleek and cool behind the wheel of some cheap used lifted trucks for sale. The SP Series 4-wheel platform stock picker is a heavy-duty stand-up lift truck used in areas where loads are bulky or extra long, such as furniture or department store warehouses.</p>
<p>Handle only loads within the rated capacity of the truck. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility.
