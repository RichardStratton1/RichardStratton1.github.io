<p>It is about as close to a full size forklift as pallet jacks get. The rough terrain forklift is an ideal piece of material handling equipment for outdoor construction and loading activities. A brief discussion of the various types of forklifts on the market can help you to understand why answering the above questions first is essential to ensure you get the right equipment for the job.</p>
<p>Double-deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay. We are known as a 'One Stop Shop' for material handling equipment. The mast shall be at full rearward tilt and the forks the elevated until the point of intersection of the two load-carrying surfaces of the forks is 12 inches from the floor.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

<p>Double Reach Trucks are commonly used in factory, food processing and general warehousing industries. Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>Our dealers carry all major brands of forklifts to include Yale, Hyster, Crown, TCM, Raymond, Daewoo, CAT, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Clark, Toyota, Linde and Barrett. Linde has developed special design features that simplify the process of picking for every height - from the layout of the control platform and control panels, to the fold-out cab railings.
