The 35 Logistics counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Counterbalance and reach forklifts are two commonly used types of truck throughout a variety of industries.

All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
